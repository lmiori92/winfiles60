# Introduction #

The setup of WinFile on the mobile phone is simple and fast (or better I hope so :-)).
Everything that's not python should available without any other package. If not, please install the _PyModulePack_.

# Details #

In the most cases you should only transfer SIS file on the mobile phone, without forgetting to install before this the _**Python 2.0 Runtime**_ (for 3rd edition onwards, 5th, Symbian^3).
On symbian S60 2nd edition you have to install the old version, _**PythonForS60**_ 1.4.5 and then WinFile.
All the sis files are already signed (WinFile sis itself doesn't need to be signed).
