This project was one of my first big ones back in 2007!
I have spent several hours during school time into thinking and implementing features:
as you could problably see, the code is quite <<hobbystic>> since back in the days I had no culture about computer science but anyway I had to invent "optimizations", "code reuse" by failure and doing.
So all in all it has been a rewarding experience!


Today the market is completely different but I really miss Python as development environment on, say, Android.
